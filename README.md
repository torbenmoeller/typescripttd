# Typescripttd
TypeScriptTD is an open source tower defense, based on the project ScriptTD.
I translated the code and to typescript, and ported the engine to Phaser, so it can run in any browser.
It is a simple tower defense, but easy to extend with new features.

# Compile
npm run-script build

compiles typescript files and copies assets and index.html to the dist folder
Everything relevant can be found in the dist folder.
